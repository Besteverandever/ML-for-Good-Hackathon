Cancer diagnosis along is lonely and frustrating, especially if you are under 40 with kids ( I feel I am the youngest one in cancer center) and then COVID-19 happen. My treatment plan got impacted but at least I am getting some treatment and doctors are doing everything to help me. Additionally, my mom's knee replacement surgery got postponed and she is now can only jump on 1 leg...

We do not have private office at home and since we are working for non profit international organization, work load increased. We are lucky enough to stay employed during this time and my employer is very flexible for me to take time off for treatment. We also have big family and good friends. We do zoom meetings with cousins, friends, etc regularly. We also do virtual zoomba classes and  exercise bike. We spend a lot of time on our backyard. We are cooking and baking more which is good because I cannot loose weight to continue with my treatments. Our 5th grader became less picky eater and tries everything now. We do family movie nights, gazing the stars nights, backyard clean up party., dance away party and during the day when i do not feel well, we play who takes best care of mommy game. It helps that kids' teachers have meetings with kids so they can feel connected. Our son goes to SKYPE Saturday school for extra activities and our daughter does hip hop classes over zoom. We also\""
